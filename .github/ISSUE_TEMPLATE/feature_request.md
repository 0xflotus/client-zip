**Why is your feature relevant to client-zip?**
Consider that this library is just a function that takes inputs and provides a Response. Relevant features include, for example, all those listed in the roadmap. Out-of-scope features include unzipping, saving the Response somewhere, or instantiating a ServiceWorker to use client-zip in a certain way (the last two features would make interesting projects using client-zip as a dependency).
